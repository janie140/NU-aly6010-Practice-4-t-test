Part I: “cats” dataset

Question: do male and female cat samples have the same body weight (“Bwt”)?

We take a two-sample two-tailed t-test for the mean body weight of the male and female cats after filtering two separate
groups of male and female.

Part 2: Whether meditation has an effect on sleep quality?

We proceed with a paired t-test on a sample of 10 students and their average sleeping quality scores in the week before the meditation workshop and the week following the meditation workshop.
